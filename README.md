# DES-Proper-Motion
This was a Summer Research Project I worked on in the UPenn Department of Physics & Astronomy. I did analysis of DES Proper Motion data and compared it to Gaia Data Release 2. 
These scripts show some of the initial feature testing for significant differences in properties and then further probing into ways to segregate High Proper Motion stars from other objects in the DES images.
Due to data being required through different testing, most of the it is done in long Python notebooks.
